Incident response is a pivotal security role in organizations that aimed to manage incidents quickly and economically.  Cybersecurity Incident Response is a valuable development in the mitigation and operational security and data protection methods to safeguard employees and their assets. Cybersecurity awareness training is a powerful approach that leverage companies to cultivate employees into developing their knowledge and awareness of best practices and strategies for safeguarding sensitive data. Incident response is an emerging field due to the exceptional rise in the security breaches. The organizations need to implement such incident responses for the data breaches. The operational teams should be equipped with the hands-on experience of the incidents. The real-world scenarios must be used as a method to enhance the knowledge of the security team. The proposed system responds to such security demands generating an environment to test the security architecture, measure, track and report Cybersecurity KPIs as overall threat exposure to reduce exposure risk. The system is an educative framework for giving a real-world experience to the users and also test their ability and agility to respond to the incidents in the given time and correctly.
